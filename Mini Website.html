	<h2 align="center" id="about">About Iron Man</h2>

	<br>

	<p align="center">
		Introduced in 2008's Iron Man, the crown jewel of the MCU is undeniably Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, whose
		greatest creation is his extensive gallery of advanced armored suits. From the clunky Mark I and the sleek Mark
		VII to the nanotechnology of Iron Man's Mark 85, Stark's collection of Iron Man armor continues to be a symbol
		of heroism. Indeed, Iron Man's suits reflect Stark's own MCU journey receiving upgrades, specializations,
		altered designs, new equipment, and even futuristic materials. The Iron Man suits prove Stark's relentless
		dedication to improving and refining not just his tech but also his perspective as an Avenger throughout his MCU
		career.
	</p>

	<p align="center">As the owner of Stark Industries, Tony Stark began as a villain in the MCU, with his gun-running
		earning him the nickname "Merchant of Death." That changed when he was taken captive by the Ten Rings terrorist
		organization. Unbeknownst to everyone involved, this was the first step toward the salvation of the universe, as
		Stark shifted his worldview away from warmongering and focused on building advanced suits of armor to protect
		the world. Here's every Iron Man suit built by Stark that appears in the MCU.
	</p>

					Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark's weaponry business after his parents'
					untimely deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to
					demonstrate a new missile for the U.S. military, Starks convoy came under fire by a terrorist group
					known as the Ten Rings and he was severely wounded. Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in
					their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift
					action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen who had inserted a powerful electromagnet in
					Stark's chest would prolong it temporarily.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon, Stark replaced the magnet with
					the RT, a miniature version of a device originally designed by his father, the Arc Reactor.
					Furthermore, he and Yinsen created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means with
					which to escape. The suit worked as planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony
					enough time to power it up to fight their terrorist captors.

					After returning from Afghanistan, Stark committed himself to building an improved version of the

					to integrate Stark's AI JARVIS and a fully-functioning HUD, apart from the hundreds of carefully
					arranged moving parts that grant Tony maneuverability while flying. Its major weakness is its
					inability to reach high altitudes without freezing, a flaw that Tony later uses to defeat Stane.
					This armor is the first one used by James "Rhodey" Rhodes preceding the official debut of War
					Machine.

					ony Stark's Mark III armor symbolized the consolidation of Iron Man as a fully-fledged superhero, a
					key turning point in the designs for Iron Man's suits of armor. The most evident change implemented
					in this model was the iconic red-and-gold coloring, inspired by one of his many luxury cars. This is
					also the first armor fully designed to hold up in battle, incorporating a whole arsenal of anti-tank
					missiles, flares, and shoulder-mounted mini-guns, besides the intensified repulsors and a stronger
					uni-beam that comes from Stark's arc reactor. Its gold titanium alloy fixed the icing problem and
					enhanced its strength and durability.
